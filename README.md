# Become a Rustacean
What I have learned :
- Master programming in Rust, a fast, safe, and powerful language used in web development, command-line tools,
blockchain, and many other domains.
- Conquer Rust's ownership model, use references to reduce memory, and learn how the compiler prevents common memory problems.
- Progress from core language fundamentals to advanced features like traits, lifetimes, and closures.
- Understand Rust's core building blocks including structs, enums, hashmaps, and more.
- Learn how to structure larger Rust projects using crates, modules, external dependencies, and more.
